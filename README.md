# zig-wren 
A basic wrapper around Wren.

Check examples/example_build.zig for how to set up your project's build.zig, and examples/all_the_things.zig for usage.

As a rule, all things that were named Wren[Thing] or wren[Thing] are now wren.[thing].  
Still needs to be majorly cleaned up.

There are a few helpers in wren.utils.
